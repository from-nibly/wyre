#default on wire encoding
It would be nice to be able to predefine outgoing message flag defaults on the Client or Server objects during instatiation or whenever a connection is established.  This way you wont have to pass in options to the send method every time you send a message.  Rather you would only set the options whenever you have send a message with non-default flags.

#Sub protocols
WS supports sub protocols and so should we!
